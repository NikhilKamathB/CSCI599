		<p>In this assignment, we have implemented surface subdivision and simplification/decimation using Loop
			Subdivision and
			Quadric Error Metrics, respectively. Before going ahead, kindly have a look at the <a
				href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/wiki">Home</a> page to understand how the folders in this
			repository have been organized. Also, make sure you have installed all the necessary libraries from the <a
				href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/blob/main/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> file
			which can
			be found at root of this repo.</p>

		<h3>How do we run the project?</h3>

		<p>To get the 'assignment 1' running, simply <code>cd</code> into <code>./assignments</code> folder and run
			<code>python assignment1.py</code>. To get to know the usage of this script, run
			<code>python assignment1.py -h</code>. Upon successful execution, you can find the results in
			<code>./assets/results/assignment1</code> folder (default). Within this folder,
			<code>cube_decimated.obj</code>
			represents the decimation result and <code>cube_subdivided.obj</code> contains the subdivision results. To
			verify
			the results with <code>Trimesh</code>, you may comment/uncomment the necessary lines in
			<code>assignment1.py</code>
			and running it again.
		</p>

		<h3>What data structure did we use to store the mesh?</h3>

		<p>For this assignment, we have used <strong>Numpy arrays</strong> to store and perform operations on the mesh.
			So why
			<strong>Numpy arrays</strong>? Although, there were other choices such as half-edge, incident matrices
			representation, etc. we have opted to go with <strong>Numpy</strong> because of its efficient computation.
			Another
			reason is that, we wanted to minimize the usage of loops in the scripts, which would otherwise lead to a
			more time
			complex solution. To perform various operations such as, identifying neighbors, getting special edges,
			orienting
			faces, computing equations of the plane, etc. we leverage the matrix operations (vectorization, broadcasting
			and
			parallelization) provided by <strong>Numpy</strong>.

		<h3>Loop Subdivision</h3>

		<p>The following is the pseudo code used for implementing surface subdivision using Loop Subdivision:</p>

		<pre><code>Algorithm:
		
		procedure loop_subdivision(mesh, iteration)
		    i &lt;- 0
		    repeat
		        1. vertices &lt;- vertices of the mesh
		           faces &lt;- faces of the mesh
		           edges &lt;- edges of the mesh
		        2. special_edges &lt;- get all the special edges such as interior, boundary and unique edges from "edges"
		        3. odd_vertices &lt;- get the set of all approximated odd vertices from the mesh
		        4. even_vertices &lt;- get the set of all approximated even vertices from the mesh
		        5. new_faces &lt;- update faces
		        6. new_vertices &lt;- stack(even_vertices, odd_vertices)
		        7. rebuild mesh with new vertices and new faces
		        8. i &lt;- i + 1
		    until i &gt;= iteration
		</code></pre>

		<p><strong>Lets discuss about the runtime</strong> - The function <a
				href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/blob/c624453264e23f00f794e5c3f24d7a1673efeb0f/src/utils/load.py#L17"><code>load_obj()</code></a>
			loads the 3D object file into and intermediary dictionary in <code>O(lines)</code> time which laters get
			translated
			into our actual <code>Numpy</code> data structure as defined by our <a
				href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/blob/c624453264e23f00f794e5c3f24d7a1673efeb0f/src/base/ds_mesh.py#L15"><code>NpMesh</code></a>
			class. The member function associated with edge retrieval from a mesh, sorts the edges and then returns a
			set of
			unique edges and special edges. All this happens in <code>O(E log E)</code> time. The odd vertices are
			defined by
			one, the immediate neighbors and two the vertices of their opposite faces. Initially, we simply let the odd
			vertices
			to be the middle point of every edge, this happens in constant time due to <code>Numpy</code>. In similar
			time
			complexity we can get the immediate neighbors. Getting the vertices of the opposite faces involves
			generating face
			masks. This happens in <code>O(F * E)</code> time, since we need to compare the faces and edges to generate
			the
			mask. All other subordinate operations such as element-wise multiplication, negations, equality checks, etc
			will
			have the time complexity <code>O(n)</code>, where <code>n</code> is the total number of elements in the
			matrix/array. Bottom line, we can get the odd vertices in <code>O(F * E)</code> time (number of Faces and
			Edges).
			Approximating the even vertices involves create an incident matrix, which gets done in <code>O(V * V)</code>
			and
			just like the previous statement, all element-wise operations takes <code>O(n)</code> time. Therefore,
			computing
			even vertices is upper bounded by <code>O(V * V)</code>. Updating faces, is associated with comparing each
			edge with
			all the existing edges and manipulating their indices. The time complexity of this function would be
			<code>O(E^2 + V^2)</code>. With all this we build a new mesh and repeat the entire process until the
			condition is
			met. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the implemented loop subdivision is upper bounded by
			<code>O(n^2)</code> (where <code>n</code> is the sum of vertices and edges) for every iteration.
		</p>

		<p>To run loop subdivision run the command <code>python assignment1.py -s &lt;ITERATION&gt;</code>. The result
			of the
			loop subdivision can be found in <code>./assets/results/assignment1/cube_subdivided.obj</code> (assuming
			that the
			param <code>--output_dir</code> remains unchanged).</p>

		<p>The following images show the new mesh generated after every iteration (4 Iterations):</p>

		<h3>Decimation - Quadric Error Metrics</h3>

		<p>The following is the pseudo code used for implementing surface simplification using <a
				href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf">Quadric Error Metric</a>:</p>

		<pre><code>Algorithm:
		
		procedure decimation(mesh, face_count)
		    1. vertices &lt;- vertices of the mesh
		       faces &lt;- faces of the mesh
		       edges &lt;- edges of the mesh
		       special_edges &lt;- get all the special edges such as interior, boundary and unique edges from "edges"
		    2. face_normal &lt;- given the faces, get all the face normals
		    3. q_matrix &lt;- use the face_normal to generate the Q matrix
		    4. valid_pairs &lt;- get a list of all valid vertex pairs for contraction
		    5. optimal_contraction_heap &lt;- get the cost of contracting every valid vertex pairs and their associate new v_dash into a heap
		    6. repeat
		        a. E, v_dash &lt;- pop the element with the least cost from the optimal_contraction_heap
		        b. vertices, q_matrix &lt;- update vertices and q_matrix to accommodate new v_dash
		        c. deleted_vertices &lt;- add the deleted vertex so as to keep track of them
		        d. faces &lt;- update the faces to account for the new v_dash and the vertex deletion
		        e. optimal_contraction_heap &lt;- update the heap by recording the cost of all valid pairs involving the most recently updated vertex (v1 - refer the paper)
		        f. rebuild mesh with new vertices and new faces
		      until face_count &gt;= faces.length
		</code></pre>

		<p><strong>Lets discuss about the runtime</strong> - The function <a
				href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/blob/c624453264e23f00f794e5c3f24d7a1673efeb0f/src/utils/load.py#L17"><code>load_obj()</code></a>
			loads the 3D object file into and intermediary dictionary in <code>O(lines)</code> time which laters get
			translated
			into our actual <code>Numpy</code> data structure as defined by our <a
				href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/blob/c624453264e23f00f794e5c3f24d7a1673efeb0f/src/base/ds_mesh.py#L15"><code>NpMesh</code></a>
			class. The member function associated with edge retrieval from a mesh, sorts the edges and then returns a
			set of
			unique edges and special edges. All this happens in <code>O(E log E)</code> time. Computing the normal
			vector for
			faces using <code>Numpy</code> falls in <code>O(F)</code> time. Following this, we have the function that
			compute
			the Q matrix for every face. Because this calculation involves computing the dot products, i.e matrix
			multiplication, therefore the time complexity for this would be in <code>O(n^3)</code> and since we are
			using
			<code>Numpy</code> the upper bound is <code>O(n^2.&lt;something&gt;)</code>. Note that, this can be
			misleading, the
			dot product takes place between a fixed dimensional <code>(4 x 4)</code> <code>K</code> matrices and this
			operation
			happens <code>|V|</code> times. When <code>|V|</code> is large, we can say that time complexity of computing
			the Q
			matrix is <code>O(V)</code>. Gathering information about the valid vertices take <code>O(V * V)</code> time
			due to
			the computation of incident matrix. And finally, we have the error computation and extracting the optimal
			<code>v_dash</code>. The most expensive operation in this is finding the inverse of the matrix which can be
			in
			<code>O(n^3)</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of elements in the invertible matrix (refer paper).
			Again,
			just because the number of items are fixed, i.e we always take the inverse of a <code>(4 x 4)</code> matrix,
			we can
			say that the complexity of this operation boils down to <code>O(V)</code>. All other activities like
			updating of
			edges, faces, etc. is done in <code>O(n)</code> time, where <code>n</code> can represent the number of
			faces/edges/vertices. All put together, we can say that the function is bounded by <code>O(n^2)</code>
			(<code>n</code> -> vertices, assuming <code>|V| &gt;&gt; 4</code>) due to the incident matrix computation
			(for every
			while loop execution), other operations, more or less happens in <code>O(V)</code> time.
		</p>

		<p>To run decimation run the command <code>python assignment1.py -d &lt;FACE_COUNT&gt;</code>. The result of the
			loop
			subdivision can be found in <code>./assets/results/assignment1/cube_decimated.obj</code> (assuming that the
			param
			<code>--output_dir</code> remains unchanged).

		<h3>Extra Credits</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Analysis of corner cases and their potential solutions:
				<ul>
					<li>For the case of loop subdivision, we were supposed to work on a closed object like a cube. For
						cases
						like these, there will be no boundary edges/vertices, the entire object is built/constructed
						using a set
						of interior edges. The code in this repo, handles boundary edge/vertex as well. The
						implementation can
						be found in <code>_get_odd_vertices()</code> and <code>_get_even_vertices()</code> <a
							href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/blob/main/src/remesh.py">here</a>. Yet
						another issue
						observed in my implementation was in decimation. When we set the desired face count to
						<code>3</code> or
						even <code>2</code> the code used to return only one face, which is technically correct. This
						has been
						rectified by adding another face in the counter clockwise direction of the existing one (check
						out
						<code>_decimation()</code> <a
							href="https://github.com/NikhilKamathB/CSCI599/blob/main/src/remesh.py">here</a>), enabling
						the
						face/plane visualization in this case from all direction.
					</li>
					<li>When the number of vertices is way greater than the number of edges, most of the matrix elements
						will be
						either represented by a zero of a boolean false. Using such matrices for computation is
						unnecessarily
						resource heavy. We can address this by using the spare matrix representation enabling efficient
						computation.</li>
					<li>In the case of loop subdivision and perhaps decimation, on any 3D object, the resultant of
						subdivision/decimation may lead to set of edges and vertices that do not obey the manifold rule
						explained in the lecture. Because, our implementation strictly checks for the triangularity of
						the mesh
						after every iteration, I believe that this case is implicitly being handled.</li>
					<li>Sometimes, we might want to maintain a subset boundaries or edges to preserve the object's
						overall
						appearance during decimation. We may address this by fixating on a set of vertices that define
						these
						boundaries/edges and then performing decimation. Similarly, we may have constrained
						edges/vertices that
						doesn't allow the algorithm the decimate on them, thus preserving important small features of
						the
						object. Loop subdivision, on the other hand, also leads to figure deformity in the areas which
						contains
						sharp curvature or creases. Again, this problem can be avoided by fixing a subset of vertices
						and not
						altering them during the subdivision process.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Preserving the original vertices after decimation
				<ul>
					<li>Yes, the original vertices after decimation can be preserved (the vertices of the new meshes are
						a
						subset of the original vertices). To run this chunk of task, simply run the command
						<code>python assignment1.py -d &lt;FACE_COUNT&gt; -f y</code>. The resultant looks something
						like this
						(when Face count = 5):
					</li>
